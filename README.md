Algorithm Spring-143

We should take 64 bits and find two the same variations for 32-64 bits long and 0-64 bit, then, #save where it is a 3 bits variation, 8 combination #and 4 bits variation, 16 combination. Add one bit next and try to find again if not find that block it's compress and find variation should be random.
